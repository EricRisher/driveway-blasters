      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Is your solar panel system underperforming? Dirty solar panels can lose
        up to 25% of their efficiency due to accumulated dirt, grime, bird
        droppings, and other debris. This buildup not only makes your panels
        look unattractive but also reduces their ability to generate electricity
        effectively. When was the last time you had your solar panels cleaned?
