                Can I Pressure Wash My Own Driveway?
              </h4>{' '}
              While homeowners can rent pressure washing equipment, there are
              risks involved. Incorrect handling of pressure washers can damage
              driveway surfaces or surrounding landscaping. Professional
              technicians are trained to use the correct pressures and cleaning
              solutions, ensuring safety and efficiency.

                How Long Does Driveway Cleaning Last?
              </h4>
              Professional driveway cleaning results typically last 6-12 months,
              depending on usage, environmental factors, and local conditions.
              Regular cleanings are recommended to maintain optimal appearance

                Can Professional Cleaning Remove All Stains?

              While most stains are completely removable, some deep, set-in
              stains might only lighten significantly. Professionals assess the
              severity of stains and choose the most effective treatments
              available, greatly enhancing your driveway's appearance.

              Before professional cleaning, clear your area of any vehicles,
              furniture, or any other objects to allow easy access. Notify the
              professionals of any specific concerns or sensitive landscaping
              areas around the driveway.
